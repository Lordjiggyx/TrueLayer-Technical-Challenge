# Details

This assignment revolves around creating a search engine that when given a pokemon name will return it's description in **Shakespearean style**

This assignment requires the use of an API endpoint to retreieve the information about the pokemon

Luckily I was given 2 API'S that will help in the creation of this search engine they are:

* [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) - This is an API connected to a well built and extensively documented database about pokemon.

* [Shakespearean Translator](https://funtranslations.com/api/shakespeare) - This is an API which converts normal text to Shakespearean style

# Implementation

To implement this search engine, I have decided to use the **"M.E.R.N"** stack to create a web application with a front end, using this stack also allows me to create the project mainly with Javascript. However I do not need a database for this project so I will just be using the following technologies:

* **NodeJS** - Node JS is an open source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code server-side. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript for server-side scripting. I used NodeJS along with Express to create my server and handle HTTP requests.
* **ReactJS** - React is a javascript library made by Facebook , it is used to create interactive UIs and design web pages for each state of the application.
* **ExpressJS** - ExpressJs is a web application framework that allows you to create robust APIs and web servers to build websites or web applications with backend functionality.

Although thee three are my main technologies I wll still use other third-party libraries in the implementation of this project they include the following:

* **Axios** - Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js
* **Concurrently** - Used to run client server and backend server at the same time
* **Reactstrap** - React component library based off of bootstrap
* **Framer Motion** - Used for animations
* **Request** - Used to make HTTP requests from NodeJs
* **Nodemon** - Used for hot reload i.e , restarting application when changes are made  
* **Puppeteer** - Library used to control Google Chrome
* **Jest** - Testing library
